Internet of Technology based Battery Management System We created circuit which monitored Charging, and Discharging at constant load of Li-ion battery. For this current and voltage and temperature sensor was used.  Using this data, we created Battery characteristic data. This helped us determine State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH). Overcharge protection circuit was placed to prevent battery from overcharging.   SOC, Voltage, Current, and Temperature  were uploaded in real-time to Firebase.  Website was created which displayed battery and its parameters in real-time.
